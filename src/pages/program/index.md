A full-time REAP-funded counselor is on Lindsay High School campus every day providing REAP students with additional counseling attention to communicate the value of higher education and to help choose the appropriate college, career path, and financial plan to get there.

          REAP counselors aid and inform REAP parents, advising them on the many ways a four-year degree will benefit their student. Parents are familiarized with the REAP Incentive-Based Scholarship Program so that they understand the financial incentive to help motivate their student to earn scores of 3.5 and 4.0 in their core classes.
