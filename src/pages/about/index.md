    REAP — Rural Education for Americans Projcet — is a non-profit foundation established to support education in rural communities. We focus on activities that directly improve the quality of education and raise the academic bar for rural students in agricultural communities, and support students who have demonstrated the ability and drive to become leaders in their communities.

    Currently, our programs provide assistance to students with first-generation college graduate aspirations in Lindsay and Orosi school districts.  REAP programs help individual students set and achieve high goals and gain hope in their futures creating a college-going culture throughout the rural community.
