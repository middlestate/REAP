    REAP — Rural Education for Americans Project — is a non-profit foundation established to support education in
    rural communities. We focus on activities that directly improve the quality of education and raise the academic
    bar for rural students in agricultural communities, and support students who have demonstrated the ability and
    drive to become leaders in their communities.
